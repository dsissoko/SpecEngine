# Agent‑Oriented Project Template

## 1. High‑Level Vision

This repository is a **project template** designed for specification‑driven
development, usable by humans and AI agents.

Main files and directories:

- `docs/`: product and technical documentation structured by phase:
  - `00_vision/`: vision, scoping, context.
  - `01_product/`: functional specification (`specifications.md`) and roadmap (`ROADMAP.md`).
  - `02_design/`: functional, software and technical design, data model, tech stack.
  - `03_delivery/plan_X.Y.md`: per‑version plans with batches (`LOT-…`) and testing strategy.
  - `04_operations/`: deployment, configuration, monitoring, incidents.
- `CONVENTIONS.md`: working processes + common format/quality standards.
- `AGENTS.md`: agent constitution (how to read `docs/`, use `FEAT/BF/LS/TS/LOT`, etc.).
- `src/`: application code.
- `infra/`: infrastructure as code and CI/CD configuration.
- `tests/`: automated test suites.

Logical pipeline driven by documentation:

> Vision → Product → Design → Plan → Code → Operate

This framework can be used either with a **human orchestrator** or with an
**AI orchestrator** (or a mix of both). Section **4. Usage** describes these
two orchestration modes and how they drive the Build / Release / Operate flows.

Core artefact types (see `AGENTS.md` for the formal index):

- `FEAT-…` — Features (product capabilities).  
- `BF-…` — Business (functional) blocks.  
- `LS-…` — Logical software subsystems.  
- `TS-…` — Technical artefacts (clusters, pipelines, brokers, …).  
- `IF-BF-…` — Functional interfaces between `BF` blocks.  
- `IF-LS-…` — Software interfaces between `LS` subsystems.  
- `IF-TS-…` — Technical interfaces (channels, endpoints, topics…) linked to `TS`.  
- `LOT-…` — Delivery batches grouping FEAT/LS/TS for a given version.

The framework requires **every artefact to be explicitly typed** with one of
these IDs, and the documentation (`docs/01_product`, `docs/02_design`,
`docs/03_delivery`, `docs/04_operations`) to maintain an **exhaustive index
of all artefacts of the target service**, across **Build**, **Release**
and **Operate** activities. Managing this index is **mandatory**:
no artefact may be created or changed without being properly referenced
in the right view.

This index is distributed per activity:

- product view (`docs/01_product`) → FEAT and roadmap entries per version,  
- functional view (`docs/02_design/functional_architecture.md`) → BF and `IF-BF-…`,  
- software view (`docs/02_design/software_architecture.md`) → LS and `IF-LS-…`,  
- technical / operations view (`docs/02_design/technical_architecture.md`, `docs/04_operations/*`) → TS and `IF-TS-…`, deployment/config/monitoring/incident procedures,  
- delivery view (`docs/03_delivery/plan_X.Y.md`) → LOT and their FEAT/LS/TS/IF-* scope per version and per batch.

These typed artefacts and their index are described in `docs/` and
`CONVENTIONS.md`, and serve as structured inputs for both humans and agents
at every step of the Build / Release / Operate flows.

## 3. Processes — Overview

Project activities are organised into three main flows:

- **Build** (create and evolve the product)
  - Vision → clarify the “why” and the context.  
  - Product → describe features (`FEAT-…`) and the roadmap.  
  - Design → structure the system into `BF` / `LS` / `TS` and interfaces (`IF-*`).  
  - Plan → organise the work into `LOT-…` per version (`plan_X.Y.md`).  
  - Code → implement the LOT artefacts in `src/` and `tests/`.  

- **Release** (promote build artefacts into deployable releases)
  - Select → choose a candidate version `vX.Y.Z` produced by the Build flow.  
  - Qualify → ensure it meets quality / performance / security / compliance criteria.  
  - Schedule → decide where and when to roll it out (environments, strategy).  
  - Approve → formally approve the release for operations (can map to a `LOT-REL-…`).  

- **Operate** (run and manage an approved release)
  - Provision → create / update technical artefacts (`TS-…`) and base infrastructure.  
  - Deploy → deploy an approved release (`vX.Y.Z`) to environments.  
  - Configure → apply and adjust runtime configuration (settings, secrets, feature flags).  
  - Observe → monitor health and behaviour (metrics, logs, traces, alerts, dashboards).  
  - Recover → investigate incidents and apply fixes or rollbacks, typically via dedicated `LOT-OPS-…` batches.

        Observe --> [*]: Service decommissioned
    }

    %% Entry into Operate for an approved release
    Release --> Operate: Approved release vX.Y.Z

    %% Recover that requires a new build/release
    Recover --> Release: New fixed release vX.Y.Z+1\nfrom Build/Release

    %% Normal evolution without incident
    Observe --> Release: New release vX.Y+1 approved
    Observe --> Provision: Infra change required (scale, new TS-…)
```

**Operate flow — from approved release to day‑to‑day operations**

| Phase      | Purpose                                              | Input artefacts                                      | Output artefacts                                     | Main roles              |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Provision  | Prepare / update technical artefacts and infra       | `TS-…` definitions, tech stack, release requirements, existing `docs/02_design/technical_architecture.md`, `tech_stack.md`, `docs/04_operations/deployment.md` | Updated `docs/04_operations/deployment.md`, updated `TS-…` topology (clusters, pipelines, brokers…), infra definitions under `infra/` | Infra / Ops (DevOps/SRE) |
| Deploy     | Deploy an approved release `vX.Y.Z` to environments  | Approved release `vX.Y.Z`, deployment topology, CI/CD configuration, `docs/04_operations/deployment.md` | Deployed release instances, rollout history, updated deployment procedures in `docs/04_operations/deployment.md` | Infra / Ops, Orchestrator |

| Recover    | Handle incidents and rollbacks via `LOT-OPS-…`       | Incident reports/symptoms, telemetry, current config, existing `docs/04_operations/incident_resolution.md`, `security.md` | `LOT-OPS-…`, fixes/rollbacks applied, updated incident runbooks and security procedures, incident records and post‑mortems | Ops, Dev, QA, Orchestrator |

At each step, these docs are not only inputs but **outputs of work**:

- `docs/03_delivery/plan_X.Y.md` is produced and refined by the Plan phase in Build.  
- Files under `docs/04_operations` are produced and refined as Operate activities
  (Provision, Deploy, Configure, Observe, Recover) are performed and improved over time.

All artefacts managed in this repository — documentation (`docs/*`), plans,
code, tests, infra (`infra/`), agent configs (`agents/`) — are subject to the
same lifecycle:

- any change must be done in a dedicated Git branch (per LOT or per coherent change),  
- that branch is reviewed via a PR/MR,  
- and only then merged into the main branch and included in the next release tag.

There is no “out of band” change: updating a plan, an operations procedure or
an infra file is treated exactly like changing application code.

## 4. Usage

This template can be used with a human in the lead, an AI orchestrator, or a mix of both.  
In all cases, the Build / Release / Operate flows, the artefact index and the mono‑LOT
Git workflow remain the single reference.

### 4.1 Human orchestration

- A human product/tech lead fills or adapts the documentation:
  - `docs/00_vision`, `docs/01_product`, `docs/02_design`, `CONVENTIONS.md`, `AGENTS.md`.
- For a target version `X.Y`, the lead creates or updates `docs/03_delivery/plan_X.Y.md`
  and defines `LOT-…` with their FEAT/LS/TS/IF-* scope and criticality.
- For each active LOT, the lead:
  - creates a dedicated Git branch (`lot/X.Y.Z-XXX`),  
  - implements the required changes in `src/`, `tests/`, `infra/`,  
  - keeps the artefact index up to date in `docs/*`.
- CI/CD and releases are configured so that tags `vX.Y.Z` trigger pipelines, deploy
  candidates and releases, using `docs/04_operations/*` as the reference for operations.

### 4.2 Agent orchestration

- An “orchestrator” agent (e.g. Codex) is configured with this repository and instructed to:
  - always read `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md` first,  
  - respect the closed list of artefact types and the Build / Release / Operate FSMs,  
  - maintain the artefact index in `docs/01_product`, `docs/02_design`,
    `docs/03_delivery`, `docs/04_operations`,  
  - work mono‑LOT and propose, rather than execute, Git commands (branch, commit, tag).
- Typical interaction pattern:
  1. The user states the flow and step, e.g.  
     “Flow Build / step Design for version 0.1: apply what the README describes.”  
  2. The agent identifies the current FSM state, lists the impacts on `docs/*`,
     `src/`, `tests/`, `infra/`, then applies the changes.  
  3. The agent outputs the Git commands to run on the LOT branch and a PR/MR summary
     describing the changes and the updated artefact index.
- Higher‑level platforms (GitHub/GitLab, issue trackers, CI/CD) remain optional glue
  around this core: the structure (docs + CONVENTIONS + AGENTS + LOTs) is tool‑agnostic.
